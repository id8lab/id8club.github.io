Last week we managed to setup a static website and configure nginx.


### python website
please clone the sample code:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mvpclub/python_website.git
```

### Databases
When you have installed sqlite
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update.
$ sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
```
you can also download the client,
so that it is easier for you to browse the databases.

download the client from [here](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)
