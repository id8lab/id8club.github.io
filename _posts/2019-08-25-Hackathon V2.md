### Overview

James Cook University’s Ideation and Innovation center “ID8 Lab” is
proud to present our second-ever Hackathon competition.
The theme for this semester will be on the topics of mobility , safety
and public health in large cities; as those are the challenges of our time.
Each team (4 people max) will battle it out for 2 days to showcase
their solution project that tackles a determined and well defined problem.
The competition will take place on 31st August and 1st of September, and
the briefing session will be held on the 26th of August. Upon signing up,
you will get an email with more detailed information.
We will provide each team with hardware (Raspberry-Pi, sensors etc)
and everything they might need to build a convincing prototype. They must
also convince the jury panel with a well thought-out business plan.
This unique competition will enable you to develop your skillset in
record timeframe. We encourage beginners to join us as it is particularly
enriching. You can join wether you're interested in software, hardware or
business & marketing.
