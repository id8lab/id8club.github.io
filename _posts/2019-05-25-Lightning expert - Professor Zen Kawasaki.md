### Lightning expert - Professor Zen Kawasaki


We had a really good presentation from Professor Zen Kawasaki who was kind enough to come to the JCU campus.
He needs someone to develope a program that can display his lightning data in a nice 3D render. He left our club with sample data to work with.

Professor Zen Kawasaki, Lightning expert with Critical Facility in Singapore.<br>
CF will operate BOLT (Broadband Observations for Lightning and Thunderstorm) all over Singapore.<br>
BOLT was developed by Osaka University, and it may locate the LF source associated with lightning activity with the time resolution submilliseconds.<br>
For one flash maximum 1000 points in 3D.<br>
Zen will introduce BOLT and its observations.<br>
