### Special guest lecture by Joseph Foggiato - 2019

Today we had a very special visit from Joeseph foggiato a 28  year Senior IT professional with extensive and broad-based experience in defining and executing Sales & Marketing Operations for Enterprise Hardware, Software and Services businesses.

He is a Senior Director, Field Sales Operations at Riverbed but aspires to teach students, so he was kind enough to come and perform a fantastic lectrure for the MVP club. 

The topic for the lecture was on sales and marketing.

Everyone was very pleased and left feeling inspired after his brilliant lecture. The students very much look forward to future lectures from Mr Foggiato. Next lecture will be announced on slack, anyone who wishes to attaend is very much welcome!
