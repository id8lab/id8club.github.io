### Installing the necessary packages

The following commands will install all required and optional dependencies:

sudo apt install build-essential cmake git pkg-config libgtk-3-dev
sudo apt install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev
sudo apt install libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev gfortran openexr
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libdc1394-22-dev

---

### Cloning the OpenCV source code

Create a directory which will hold the repositories and clone the OpenCVâ€™s and OpenCV contrib repositories with the following commands:

mkdir ~/opencv_build && cd ~/opencv_build
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git

At the time of writing, the default version in the github repositories is version 4.0.0. If you want to install an older version of OpenCV, cd to both opencv and opencv_contrib directories and run git checkout <opencv-version>

---

### Configuring OpenCV with CMake

Once the download is completed create a temporary build directory, and switch to it:

cd ~/opencv_build/opencv
mkdir build && cd build

Set up the OpenCV build with CMake:

cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
    -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
    -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=ON \
    -D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON \
    -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=~/opencv_build/opencv_contrib/modules \
    -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..

Once the CMake build system is finalized you will see something like bellow:

### Compiling OpenCV

Modify the -j flag according to your processor. If you do not know the number of cores your processor you can find it by typing nproc. My system has 8 cores, so I am using the -j8 flag.

Start the compilation process:

make -j8

The compilation may take several minutes or more, depending on your system configuration. Once it is completed you will see something like bellow:

---

### Installing OpenCV

Once the compile process is completed install OpenCV with:

sudo make install

---

### Verifying OpenCV installation

To check whether OpenCV has been installed successfully type the following command and you should see the OpenCV version:

pkg-config --modversion opencv

can also try running a new python window and see if "import cv2" works.

if not you may have to run "pip install opencv-python"



4.0.0
