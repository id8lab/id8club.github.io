#### VISION
“By the students, for the students”, this motto holds true for this club as it is born from the desire of the most passionate students to have a platform enabling them to unleash a greater part of their potential by engaging with complex problems, taken from or applicable to real life industry standards. The student participants will be dealing with software (software engineering) as well as hardware (Such as raspberry pi) technologies. In addition they will also learn about the business side of technology with an intense focus on entrepreneurship. This club distinguishes itself from the existing communities and clubs in JCU as it will be run as a start-up, with a functional executive architecture, relying on modern development strategies such as SCRUM.

#### BENEFITS FOR JCU SINGAPORE
This club aims to elevate the industry readiness of JCU students by placing them in an environment and work structure which aims to resemble the industry as closely as possible. Thanks to the multitude of passionate people involved with the club, we aim to grow a network with industry professionals & other universities to put JCU’s IT program on the map. 
All activities performed in the club are meant to be real projects with the intention of real-life deployment. This means that the students get to see through a project in a manner different from coursework assignments. Furthermore, these projects will go directly into each student’s portfolio, improving greatly the strength of JCU students’ applications.
