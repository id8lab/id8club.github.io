### IoT Image Recognition
This project was inspired by the poor attendance system currently implemented in JCU. How many times have you missed attendance because you forgot to tap in during class? for your average student it's probably more than you can count.

Wouldn't it be nice if you could just walk in to the classroom and your presence alone would be enough to clock your attendance.
This might be possible using face recognition. By having cameras scanning the faces of people in the classroom the attendance would all be automated. 

It could potentially also stop people from being able to "tap and leave" by monitoring the presence of students throughout the entire lecture.
